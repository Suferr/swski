# HTML Introduction

## What is HTML?

* HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
* HTML is a progamming language that will make you a website
* HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content

Example of am HTML Code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

Example Explained:

* `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares an HTML5 document.
* `<html>` is the root element.
* `<head>` contains meta info.
* `<title>` sets the page title.
* `<body>` holds visible content.
* `<h1>` defines a heading.
* `<p>` defines a paragraph.

## HTML Element

An HTML element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. The full structure of an element includes everything from the opening tag to the closing tag.

#### Example:

```html
<h1>My First Heading</h1>  
<p>My first paragraph.</p>  
```

* `<h1>` is the start tag, **My First Heading** is the content, and `</h1>` is the end tag.
* `<p>` works the same way for paragraphs.

Some elements, like `<br>`, are **self-closing** and donâ€™t need an end tag.
