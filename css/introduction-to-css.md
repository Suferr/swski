# Introduction to CSS

## What is CSS?

* CSS stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**.
* It controls how HTML elements appear on a webpage.
* It allows styling for multiple pages with a single stylesheet.
* Styles can be written inline, inside a `<style>` tag, or in an external `.css` file.

***

### **Why Use CSS?**

* Separates content (HTML) from design.
* Ensures consistency across multiple web pages.
* Makes websites more visually appealing.
* Helps create **responsive designs** that adapt to different screen sizes.

### **CSS Example**

The following CSS styles a webpage with a blue background, a centered white heading, and a styled paragraph.

```css
cssCopyEditbody {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

### **How CSS Solved a Big Problem**

* Before CSS, HTML used `<font>` and inline styles for formatting.
* This made managing large websites difficult and time-consuming.
* CSS **separates design from content**, making web development **faster and more efficient**.

By using CSS, web design is cleaner, more flexible, and easier to maintain! ðŸš€
